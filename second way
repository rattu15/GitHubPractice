Let me just recap the first method tho
First , when you are done with the pull request, that is when you push the pull request to origin, and it gets merged.
Your own account's forked repo will be out of date because other person cannot make changes to your account.
now, on your terminal, to fetch the main branch of the project that you pulled do this:
1. Checkout to your main branch
2. after that run this: "git reset --hard upstream/main"
3. now push to origin, your main branch.
TADA!
